# The Description Length of Deep Learning Models

This repo contains the code for the experiments in "The Description Length of Deep Learning Models": https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07044.pdf

For the prequential experiments, we uses Keras.

For the variational experiments, we uses pytorch and the library PyVarInf: https://github.com/ctallec/pyvarinf
